# Building a video search system based on Milvus

- In this [notebook](video_similarity_search.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform similar video search. This example uses a VGG model to extract image features that are then used with Milvus to build a system that can perform the searches. 

- Here is the [quick start](quick_deploy) for a deployable version of a similar video search system.
